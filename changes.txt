reimplemented multi-wallet service into mainstream builds
testing verify transaction with private view key
fixed tracking code
moved tracking to showkeys in wallet
fixed issue where daemon would sometimes freeze on exit
added sign/verify message to help prevent github releases (Jerry will post his PK wallet publicly, message with release will prove was posted by Jerry or someone with his private keys)
Chain can not rollback further than spendable age to disincentivize 51 attacks
transfers can be tracked by incoming, outgoing, & optional blockheight
private viewkey shown in showkeys also
extra check to verify signature
zawy evil bug fix
