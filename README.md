# Pennykoin


Build only works on Ubuntu 16 LTS. 18 is not supported at this time. Make sure the following prerequisites are installed. 
 
     apt install screen make cmake build-essential libboost-all-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libzmq3-dev libunbound-dev libsodium-dev libminiupnpc-dev libreadline6-dev libldns-dev


   For fresh nodes, you will need to download this version of the blockchain and download it to your chain data directory. On Linux, this will be ~/.PennyKoin, on Windows: %appdata%\Pennykoin.
